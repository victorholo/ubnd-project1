# Private Blockchain Application

You are starting your journey as a Blockchain Developer, this project allows you to demonstrate
that you are familiarized with the fundamentals concepts of a Blockchain platform.
Concepts like:
    - Block
    - Blockchain
    - Wallet
    - Blockchain Identity
    - Proof of Existance

## How to test application functionalities?

To test  application I recommend you to use POSTMAN, this tool will help you to make the requests to the API.

1. Run your application using the command `node app.js`
You should see in your terminal a message indicating that the server is listening in port 8000:
> Server Listening for port: 8000

2. To make sure your application is working fine and it creates the Genesis Block you can use POSTMAN to request the Genesis block:
    ![Request: http://localhost:8000/block/0 ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca360cc_request-genesis/request-genesis.png)
3. Make your first request of ownership sending your wallet address:
    ![Request: http://localhost:8000/requestValidation ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca36182_request-ownership/request-ownership.png)
4. Sign the message with your Wallet:
    ![Use the Wallet to sign a message](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca36182_request-ownership/request-ownership.png)
5. Submit your Star
     ![Request: http://localhost:8000/submitstar](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca365d3_signing-message/signing-message.png)
6. Retrieve Stars owned by me
    ![Request: http://localhost:8000/blocks/<WALLET_ADDRESS>](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/April/5ca362b9_retrieve-stars/retrieve-stars.png)
7. Retrieve block by hash
    GET Request: http://localhost:8000/block-by-hash/<Block-hash>
7. Validate blockchain
    GET Request: http://localhost:8000/chaincheck
